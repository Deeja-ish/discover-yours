# Discover Yours

## Project Overview

**Discover Yours** is an innovative platform dedicated to empowering Nigerian youth by promoting creativity, fostering hobby exploration, and providing essential resources to help individuals pursue their dreams beyond traditional academic paths. In a society that often prioritizes conventional success metrics, "Discover Yours" aims to unlock diverse talents and passions, offering a supportive community and practical guidance for alternative career and personal development journeys.

## The Problem We Address

In Nigeria, a significant challenge lies in the societal emphasis on formal education and high academic scores as the sole indicators of success. This narrow perspective often stifles creativity and prevents talented youth from exploring passions in fields like music, arts, sports, or entrepreneurship. Many gifted individuals face a lack of support and encouragement to develop their non-academic talents, leading to unfulfilled potential and limited personal expression. "Discover Yours" directly confronts this by providing a platform that:

* **Validates Diverse Talents:** Offers an avenue for individuals to express themselves and develop skills outside the traditional educational system.
* **Facilitates Personal Growth:** Paves the way for holistic development, encouraging youth to discover and refine skills they genuinely enjoy.
* **Centralizes Resources:** Consolidates learning materials, motivational content, and community support into one accessible hub.

## Technical Stack

"Discover Yours" leverages a combination of robust and scalable technologies to deliver its content and manage user interactions:

    * **Custom Backend API:** (e.g., built with Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, PHP/Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Go) responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.
    * **SQL Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) for structured storage of user sign-up information and other application data.

## How It Works (SQL Backend)

The sign-up process for "Discover Yours" with the new SQL backend will follow this flow:

1.  **User Interaction:** Users fill out the sign-up form on the Netlify-hosted frontend.
2.  **Frontend Submission:** When the form is submitted, a JavaScript `fetch` request captures the form data.
3.  **Backend API Interaction:** This data is sent via a `POST` request to an endpoint on your custom Backend API.
4.  **Data Processing & Storage:** The Backend API receives the data, validates it, and then inserts it as a new record into the configured SQL database table.
5.  **Response & Feedback:** The Backend API sends a JSON response back to the frontend, indicating success or failure. The frontend then displays appropriate messages to the user.
